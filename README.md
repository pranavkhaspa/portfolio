## Notes on GSAP

This project utilizes GSAPâ€™s premium plugins (now freely available) to create engaging animations:

- **ScrollTrigger**:  
  Enables scroll-based animations, such as parallax effects, section reveals, and pinned elements that respond to user scrolling. Used for seamless transitions as users navigate the site.

- **MorphSVG**:  
  Facilitates smooth transitions between SVG shapes, allowing for creative visual effects like transforming icons or logos into different forms.

- **SplitText**:  
  Breaks text into characters, words, or lines for animated text effects, such as staggered reveals, typing animations, or dynamic hover interactions.
